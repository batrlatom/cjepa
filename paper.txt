reliance on spurious pixel-level correlations (Zholus et al.,
2022; Nishimoto & Matsubara, 2025; Ferraro et al., 2023;
Feng et al., 2025; Lei et al., 2025). Inspired by this perspective, object-centric models have been extensively developed for learning visual dynamics (Kipf et al., 2022; Zadaianchuk et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Mosbach et al., 2025;
Villar-Corrales et al., 2023), and more recently adopted as a
foundation for learning world models (Ferraro et al., 2023;
Nishimoto & Matsubara, 2025). However, learning on top of
object-centric representations alone is not sufficient. Existing works have shown that, without explicit mechanisms to
guide interaction learning, models can easily fall back on object self-dynamics or exploit incidental correlations (VillarCorrales et al., 2023; Lei et al., 2025). This realization has
spurred growing interest in object-centric world models that
explicitly learn interactions (Kipf et al., 2020; Feng et al.,
2025; Mosbach et al., 2025) or causal structure (Zholus
et al., 2022; Nishimoto & Matsubara, 2025; Lei et al., 2025).

1. Introduction
World models (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018) provide a unifying abstraction for learning, predicting, and reasoning about
the dynamics of complex environments, enabling scalable
planning and control directly in latent space from highdimensional observations (Hafner et al., 2019; 2025). At
their core, effective world modeling benefits from represen*

Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions

These approaches often enforce interactions by separating
temporal dynamics from object interactions (Mosbach et al.,
2025; Villar-Corrales et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2025), regularizing attention sparsity (Lei et al., 2025), leveraging graph
structures (Kipf et al., 2020), or relying on downstreamspecific methods (Ferraro et al., 2023; Nishimoto & Matsubara, 2025). Together, these works emphasize the importance
of interactions in world modeling, while leaving open the
question of how interaction structure can be made functionally necessary through the learning objective itself.

masked prediction as a causal inductive bias, showing that
latent interventions make interaction reasoning necessary
for minimizing the training objective. Taken together, this
leads to four main contributions:
• We introduce C-JEPA, an object-centric world model
that uses object-level masking as a latent intervention,
which enforces interaction-dependent prediction.
• C-JEPA consistently improves visual reasoning over
multi-object interactions, with particularly large gains
on counterfactual questions.

Accordingly, we propose Causal-JEPA (C-JEPA), a simple
yet effective approach for object-centric world modeling
with a causal inductive bias from object-level intervention.
This design is motivated by the fact that existing patchbased masked prediction approaches (He et al., 2022; Fan
et al., 2023; Thoker et al., 2025; Tessler et al., 2024; Tong
et al., 2022) optimize for local patch correlations, without
enforcing object-level interaction reasoning. We propose
an object-level masking that trains the model to infer an object’s latent trajectory from others’ evolving states, inducing
counterfactual-like interventions during learning. Our masking strategy prevents shortcut solutions such as trivial temporal interpolation, making interaction reasoning necessary
for minimizing the prediction objective. At the same time,
C-JEPA remains architecturally flexible and can incorporate
auxiliary variables such as actions and proprioception.

• C-JEPA enables highly efficient predictive control,
achieving comparable performance to patch-based
world models while using orders-of-magnitude fewer
tokens and substantially faster MPC planning.
• We provide an analysis of how object-level masked
prediction can induce a causal inductive bias, making
interaction reasoning functionally necessary.

2.1. Structured World Models for Dynamics Learning
World modeling in dynamical scenes requires structured representations capturing entities and their interactions. Some
approaches rely on weak supervision over entity information (Zholus et al., 2022; Ferraro et al., 2023; Lei et al., 2025)
or reinforcement-learning–specific architectures (Ferraro
et al., 2023; Nishimoto & Matsubara, 2025), while others
build self-supervised and generally applicable world models
using object-centric representations. For example, several
methods explicitly decompose self-dynamics and interactions through architectural factorization (Feng et al., 2025;
Villar-Corrales et al., 2023; Mosbach et al., 2025). Subsequent work move beyond reconstruction to reduce redundancy in learned representations. While reconstruction-free,
SlotFormer (Wu et al., 2023) does not explicitly enforce
interaction structure, and C-SWM (Kipf et al., 2020) relies
on a fixed relational graph, limiting adaptability. SPARTAN (Lei et al., 2025) learns world models directly in latent
space and encourages interaction selectivity via sparse attention. However, none of these works induces interactionaware structure through the learning objective itself.

Notably, the compactness of object-centric representations,
when combined with the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) (LeCun, 2022), encourages the model to
concentrate on the essential factors governing object dynamics within a low-dimensional latent space, thereby reducing
both computational and memory overhead. In contrast to
patch-based predictors, where attention scales quadratically
with a large number of patch tokens, entity-level representations apply the same quadratic attention mechanism over
a much smaller token set, resulting in significantly lower
training and inference costs.
In Sec. 5, we evaluate C-JEPA from two perspectives, visual reasoning and predictive control. We first evaluate
our approach on CLEVRER (Yi et al., 2020), a video QA
benchmark involving multi-object interactions, and show
that object-level masking leads to consistent improvements.
In particular, C-JEPA improves visual question answering,
with a roughly 20% absolute gain on counterfactual reasoning over the same architecture without object-level masking.
We further evaluate C-JEPA in a model predictive control
(MPC) setting on the Push-T manipulation task. Compared
to patch-based world models such as DINO-WM (Zhou
et al., 2025), C-JEPA achieves comparable task performance
while using only 1.02% of the total input feature size, which
translates to more than 8× faster model predictive control.
Finally, in Sec. 6, we formally characterize object-level

2.2. Masking-Based Representation Learning
Masked image modeling was originally introduced as a
scalable self-supervised learning paradigm to improve representation quality (He et al., 2022; Tong et al., 2022). Subsequent work explored guided masking strategies to enhance
representations by selectively masking regions informed by
motion or dynamics (Fan et al., 2023; Thoker et al., 2025;
2

Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions

Tessler et al., 2024). Nakano et al. (2024) combines masking with object-centric representations, but applies masking
to image patch tokens for computational efficiency, while
object representations are used only as conditioning signals.
Masking has also been used in causal discovery to identify
latent structure (Ng et al.; Yang et al., 2021; Nam, 2023), but
these methods typically assume fixed or identifiable graphs
and focus on disentanglement or structure recovery, rather
than flexible world modeling. Finally, (Xiao et al., 2023)
interpreted masking as inducing counterfactual variations,
which aligns with our use of masking, but they also assumed
a structural causal model and focused on robust fine-tuning.
In contrast, our work adopts masking as an object-level latent intervention to shape predictive dependencies in a world
model as a principled inductive bias for learning dynamics.

cluding DINO (Oquab et al., 2024) and DINOv2 (Caron
et al., 2021), as feature encoders, inheriting strong semantic
and invariance properties from large-scale pretraining. In
our framework, we use Slot Attention to encode each observation into a fixed-size set of object-centric latent states,
yielding a set representation St = {s1t , . . . , sN
t }, where
each slot corresponds to a distinct entity in the scene.

4. Method
In this section, we introduce C-JEPA, an object-centric latent world model that applies object-level masking during
training to induce interaction-aware predictive representations. All notation is summarized in Appendix A.
4.1. Problem Setting

3. Preliminaries

We consider a video-based dynamical system observed
through a sequence of images. Let Xt ∈ RH×W ×C denote the pixel-level observation at time t. An object-centric
encoder g maps each frame to a set of object-centric slots,

Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture JEPA (LeCun, 2022) defines a self-supervised learning paradigm that
learns to predict in representation space without reconstructing pixels, focusing instead on modeling predictive relationships between latent embeddings that capture semantic
structure in the data. This formulation has been progressively extended from image-level masked joint embedding
prediction in I-JEPA (Assran et al., 2023), to spatiotemporal
tube-based prediction in video with V-JEPA (Bardes et al.,
2024), and further to integrated understanding, prediction,
and planning in V-JEPA2 (Assran et al., 2025). By avoiding
reconstruction-driven objectives, JEPA-style models learn
representations that are directly aligned with prediction and
control, making them particularly well suited for world
modeling and autonomous decision-making (LeCun, 2022;
Assran et al., 2023; Bardes et al., 2024; Assran et al., 2025).
Following prior works (Zhou et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025),
we employ frozen target encoders and optimize the predictor with a joint embedding prediction objective, aligning
predicted latents to target latents.

St = g(Xt ) = {s1t , . . . , sN
t },

sit ∈ Rd ,

where N is the fixed number of slots and d is the dimensionality of each slot. The set representations St are permutationequivariant with respect to the slot ordering. We consider
a history window of length Th and a prediction horizon of
length Tp . Accordingly, we define the history index set
T := {t − Th + 1, . . . , t}, and the full history–future prediction interval T := {t − Th + 1, . . . , t + Tp }. Given past
object states ST , the world model aims to predict future
object states {St+1 , . . . , St+Tp }.
Masked and Visible Object Sets. For any time step τ
in the history window T , we partition the object set Sτ
into a masked subset and an unmasked context subset. Let
Mτ ⊂ {1, . . . , N } denote the indices of masked objects at
time τ . We then define
Sτm = {siτ | i ∈ Mτ },

Object-Centric Representation via Slot Attention Slot
Attention (Locatello et al., 2020) was introduced as a mechanism for learning object-centric representations by iteratively grouping feature maps into a fixed set of slots through
competitive attention. By alternating between attentionbased assignment and slot updates, it produces a set of
object-level representations without requiring supervision.
Subsequent work extended this formulation from images
to videos (Kipf et al., 2022; Zadaianchuk et al., 2023; Aydemir et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2022). Unlike image-based
Slot Attention, video extensions must additionally maintain slot identity over time, which is typically achieved by
conditioning slot updates on previous-frame slots. Notably,
some approaches such as VideoSAUR (Zadaianchuk et al.,
2023) leverage powerful pretrained foundation models, in-

Sτc = {sjτ | j ∈
/ Mτ }.

(2)

The masked set Sτm denotes the subset of object states selected for masking, whose observations are replaced by
mask tokens S̃τm , while the remaining states Sτc are provided as context. During training, f learns to recover
masked tokens within ST and to predict future states
{St+1 , . . . , St+Tp } under masking. At inference time, f
is used solely for forward prediction from a fully observed
history ST , without masking.
Auxiliary Observable Variables. In addition to object
states, we allow for auxiliary observable variables that influence state transitions. For example, when actions and
proprioceptive signals are available, we denote these variables by Ut = {at , pt }, where at represents actions and

pt represents proprioceptive signals. These variables are
treated as external to the object-level state representation
and incorporated as additional conditioning inputs alongside object states. This enables the model to capture both
object–object dependencies and action-mediated influences
within a unified object-centric framework, consistent with
treating observable sources as auxiliaries (Kim et al., 2025).

We now describe the core design of C-JEPA, which introduces object-level masking as a structured latent intervention for learning interaction-aware dynamics.
Object-Level Masking for Latent Interventions. Fig. 2

the object-centric representation St , together with auxiliary
variables Ut , is represented as a set of entity tokens Zt =

While future entity tokens are always masked for prediction,
we additionally mask the observable latent states of selected
objects across the history window T according to a masking
index set M, preserving only the earliest time step t0 as an
identity anchor. The identity anchor is introduced to address
the permutation equivariance of slot-based representations
with respect to object ordering, which motivates omitting
positional encodings along the entity dimension, consistent
with prior work (Wu et al., 2023; 2021). As a result, identity
information of each entity must be provided for masked
tokens, enabling the transformer predictor to distinguish
which entities are masked and to predict appropriately.

The history term suppresses reliance on trivial self-dynamics

Remark 1 (Causal Interpretation of Object-Level Masking).
In C-JEPA, prediction is governed by structured dependencies among object states and exogenous variables, without
assuming a fixed or explicitly parameterized causal graph.
Here, the term “causal" refers to temporally directed predictive dependencies from past object states to future states
that remain stable under object-level masking, rather than
claims of causal identifiability.

Object-level masking acts as a latent intervention that poses
counterfactual-like queries during training by selectively
removing access to object states. This introduces a causal

Concretely, we define the masked token as

inductive bias that enforces reliance on interaction-relevant
variables. In line with observations in Lei et al. (2025),
the predictor’s attention mechanism gives rise to statedependent interaction patterns that can be interpreted as a
soft, local relational structure capturing predictive influence.
We formalize this interpretation in Sec. 6.
Inference. At inference time, C-JEPA performs forward
latent prediction following Eq. 4, with a fully observable
history and masking applied only to future tokens. This
procedure aligns with the standard objective of latent world
modeling, enabling direct rollout of future object states for
downstream planning, control, and reasoning.

5. Experiments
In this section, we evaluate C-JEPA from two complementary perspectives, focusing on visual reasoning in Sec. 5.1
and predictive control in Sec. 5.2. Across experiments,
we primarily adopt VideoSAUR (Zadaianchuk et al., 2023)
as the object-centric encoder g, which aggregates frozen
DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2024) features into object-centric
latents. In Sec. 5.1, we additionally report results using
SAVi (Kipf et al., 2022) to ensure comparability with baseline models. Implementation and pretraining details are
deferred to Appendix D.

reconstruction-free setting as C-JEPA, we additionally evaluate reconstruction-free variants of the baseline models.
• SlotFormer (Wu et al., 2023) performs autoregressive rollouts over object latents, serving as a canonical
baseline without explicit interaction constraints. We
evaluate both SlotFormer (+/–Recon.).

5.1. Causal-JEPA for Visual Reasoning

• OCVP-Seq (Villar-Corrales et al., 2023) factorizes
self-dynamics and object interactions at the attention
level. We evaluate both OCVP-Seq (+/–Recon.).

Task and Evaluation. We first evaluate visual reasoning
on CLEVRER (Yi et al., 2020), a synthetic video benchmark
for physical and causal understanding in dynamic scenes.
CLEVRER consists of videos depicting multiple interacting
objects and question–answer pairs for evaluating descriptive,
predictive, explanatory and counterfactual reasoning over
object interactions.

• OC-JEPA is a history-unmasked variant of C-JEPA
that uses the same architecture while masking only
future tokens, isolating the effect of masking-induced
inductive bias.

To enable reasoning from predicted object trajectories, we
adopt ALOE (Ding et al., 2021), following the evaluation
setup of SlotFormer (Wu et al., 2023). ALOE is designed to
perform reasoning directly on stacked object-centric representations over time, using a language transformer to condition attention on the input question. Briefly, we train
C-JEPA and baseline world models, and roll out 128-frame
input videos to 160 frames to produce imagined trajectories.
ALOE is then trained on these model-generated trajectories
for downstream questions. We use a fixed number of seven
object slots across all CLEVRER experiments. Further data
and evaluation details are in Appendix F.

All baselines use the same pretrained SAVi encoder for fair
comparison. We defer additional details to Appendix H.
Results. Tab. 1 shows the comparison between OC-JEPA
and C-JEPA provides a clean ablation demonstrating that
performance gains stem from the learning objective rather
than object-centric representations alone. Introducing
object-level masking consistently improves performance,
indicating that the causal inductive bias induced by the
objective is the key driver. Notably, improvements are substantially larger on counterfactual questions than on overall
accuracy or other question categories (See full results in
Appendix I), suggesting that masking does not merely enhance predictive accuracy but directly strengthens counterfactual reasoning. This aligns with the training setup, where
object-level masking exposes the model to counterfactuallike queries through latent interventions. Finally, excessive
masking can remove informative dependencies, indicating

Baseline Models. We evaluate three distinct object-centric
world modeling architectures. Since ALOE presupposes
object-centric representations, VQA evaluation is restricted
to object-centric models, and non-object-centric baselines
are omitted. To ensure a fair comparison under the same

Tab. 2 shows a comparison against object-centric baselines
under reconstruction and non-reconstruction settings. Results show that removing reconstruction leads to a severe
performance degradation in SlotFormer (Wu et al., 2023), indicating a strong reliance on pixel-level supervision. OCVPSeq (Villar-Corrales et al., 2023) exhibits a comparatively
modest decline, suggesting that its architectural factorization partially mitigates the loss of reconstruction-based signals. In contrast, C-JEPA achieves the strongest performance without any reconstruction, highlighting the effectiveness of its decoder-free design and masking-based learning objective. Full results are available in Appendix I.

• DINO-WM (Zhou et al., 2025) operates on patch-level
representations and employs a autoregressive causal
transformer predictor.
• DINO-WM (reg.) (Darcet et al., 2024) uses a DINOv2with-register backbone with the same patch-based predictor, isolating the effect of representation.

Task and Evaluation. To evaluate world model learning
in a control-oriented setting, we use the PushT (Bekris et al.,
2025) environment, a robotic manipulation benchmark involving contact-rich object interactions in which an agent
must reason about object dynamics and contact effects over
time to achieve goal-directed behavior. Following the planning pipeline introduced in Zhou et al. (2025), at time step
t planning is performed by solving a finite-horizon optimal control problem in the latent object-centric state space
induced by the learned world model. Given the current history window ST , we optimize a sequence of future actions
at:t+H−1 over a planning horizon H as

• OC-DINO-WM applies an object-centric encoder on
top of DINOv2 patch embeddings, while keeping the
DINO-WM predictor and objective unchanged, isolating the effect of representation alone.
• OC-JEPA is a history-unmasked variant of C-JEPA,
masking only future tokens.
Results. Table 3 highlights a clear progression from patchbased to object-centric world modeling. The patch-based
DINO-WM achieves the highest success rate, but at the cost
of operating over a large token space. Replacing patch tokens with object-centric slots in OC-DINO-WM reduces
the latent token space to 1.02%, but results in a pronounced
performance degradation, showing that object-centric representations alone do not suffice for accurate long-horizon prediction. Introducing a JEPA-style predictor in OC-JEPA partially recovers performance while preserving the efficiency
of object-centric representations, indicating the advantage
of joint latent prediction over autoregressive objectives.

Baseline Models. We construct a series of world model
baselines based on DINO-WM and compare them to
VideoSAUR-based C-JEPA. This allows all models, including C-JEPA, to start from the same frozen DINOv2 embeddings and differ only in the predictor architecture and its
inputs, enabling a controlled comparison. We defer additional details to Appendix H.

tions is provided in Appendix K.
Assumption 1 (Temporally Directed Predictive Dependencies). Object-level state transitions are governed by timedirected predictive dependencies. The future state of an
object is determined by past object observations and auxiliary variables without requiring instantaneous causal effects
within the same time step.
Assumption 2 (Shared Transition Mechanism). Latent state
transitions are governed by a shared mechanism. Although
object states vary across time and episodes, the conditional
distribution of future states given a finite history remains
invariant across trajectories.
Assumption 3 (Object-Aligned Latent Representation).
Each slot corresponds to a coherent object-level state variable and these representations provide a sufficient abstraction for reasoning about object dynamics.
Assumption 4 (Finite-History Sufficiency). A finite history
window of length Th suffices to predict future object states
under the predictive dependencies of the system.

as a latent intervention during training. Despite using only
1.02% of the latent tokens, it achieves performance comparable to patch-based world models. Because predictor rollouts
dominate the computational cost in model-based planning,
this reduction directly translates to efficiency gains. Under
identical settings on a single L40s GPU, C-JEPA achieves
over 8× faster planning, requiring 673 seconds on average
across three seeds to evaluate 50 trajectories, compared to
5,763 seconds for DINO-WM. Overall, C-JEPA reconciles
the efficiency of object-centric world models with the performance of image-based approaches by combining joint
latent prediction with object-level masking.

Note. We emphasize that we do not assume causal sufficiency. It is important to permit unobserved confounders
when using object-centric representations, as they do not
assume full observability of the underlying system. We also
do not assume a first-order Markov process at the object
level. Future object states may depend on a history of past
states rather than solely on Zt , as velocity cannot be inferred
from a single observation. Furthermore, we do not assume
global sparsity of the underlying dynamics, which has been
shown to be overly restrictive (Pandaram et al., 2025).

Action and Proprioception as Auxiliary Nodes. As discussed in Sec. 4.1, C-JEPA treats auxiliary variables, such as
actions and proprioceptive signals, as separate entities that
condition the predictor. In contrast, DINO-WM (Zhou et al.,
2025) concatenates these signals with patch representations,
incorporating control inputs into the visual representation.
As shown in Fig. 3, modeling auxiliary variables as separate
entities consistently outperforms concatenation into object
latents, justifying their treatment as explicit variables.

6.2. Interaction-Inducing Inductive Bias
This subsection analyzes the inductive bias induced by predicting missing object representations from partial observations over a temporal window T . We show that masked
history prediction forces the predictor to rely on a minimal
sufficient set of contextual variables beyond the target object
itself, which we formalize as an influence neighborhood.
Definition 1 (Influence Neighborhood under Masked Completion). Let ZT denote the set of entity tokens over the
(−i)
history window, and let ZT denote all variables in ZT
excluding the history of object i, except for a minimal identity anchor used to preserve object identity. For a masked
object state zti at time t, the influence neighborhood Nt (i)
(−i)
is a minimal sufficient subset Nt (i) ⊆ ZT such that

= p zti | Nt (i) .

Ablation on Masking Strategy. In addition to objectlevel masking, we evaluate token- and tube-level masking
across both reasoning and control tasks. While token- or
tube-level masking can occasionally match the performance
of object-level masking depending on the task, object-level
masking provides a more structured and controllable inductive bias. This results in more stable training behavior and
superior performance on interaction-heavy queries. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis in Appendix J.

6. Theoretical Perspective: Causal Inductive
Bias of Latent Interventions
This section analyzes why C-JEPA yields stronger forward
prediction than future-only world modeling objectives.
6.1. Assumption

Minimality is defined in the sense that no strict subset of
Nt (i) satisfies this condition.

We first set practically motivated assumptions that clarify
the scope of our analysis. Detailed discussion of the assump-

Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions

cover the state of a masked object under partial observability. The concept of influence neighborhoods is closely
related to notions of Markov blankets and sufficient statistics (Pearl, 2009; Koller & Friedman, 2009), and we discuss
these connections in Appendix B.2. We define the influence
neighborhood for a single masked object state, and masking multiple objects during training corresponds to jointly
learning several such conditional dependencies in parallel,
without altering the definition.

Ke et al., 2021). In contrast, intervention-stable influence
neighborhoods capture the variables that are necessary
for prediction under controlled perturbations, making them
useful for reasoning, planning, and model-based control.
C-JEPA identifies such neighborhoods through its learning
objective, without requiring an explicit causal graph.
Remark 3 (Transfer of Bidirectional Training to Forward
Prediction). Due to bidirectional masked prediction during
training, the influence neighborhood Nt (i) abstracts away
temporal direction. Although the true system dynamics
evolve via a forward transition st+1 = Ψ(st ), Nt (i) can be
interpreted as a direction-agnostic interaction structure that
abstracts away edge direction and captures variables jointly
informative about an object’s state, independent of whether
this information arises from past or future observations.

Theorem 1 (Interaction Necessity under Masked History
Completion). Consider the masked history prediction loss
from Eq. 6 for object i at time t:
h
i
2
Lihistory := E ẑti − zti 2 ,
(9)
(−i)

where ẑti is computed from the observable history ZT
following Eq. 4, and the expectation is taken with respect
(−i)
to the conditional distribution of zti given ZT . Under
Assumptions 1–4 and Definition 1, the optimal predictor
that minimizes equation 9 satisfies
h
i


(−i)
ẑti ∗ = E zti ZT
= E zti Nt (i) .
(10)

As a result, minimizing Lmask induces latent representations
that encode interaction constraints invariant to the direction
of information flow. Under Assumption 2, predicting an
object’s state during training depends on the same variables
that govern its forward dynamics from past observations,
irrespective of temporal direction.

7. Conclusion
Consequently, any predictor that fails to utilize information
in Nt (i) cannot attain the minimum achievable expected
reconstruction error under masked completion.

In this paper, we presented C-JEPA, which combines joint
embedding prediction with object-level masking to introduce the causal inductive bias directly through the learning
objective. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate JEPA with object-centric world modeling. By treating
object masking as latent, counterfactual-like interventions,
C-JEPA learns interaction-aware dynamics without relying
on reconstruction losses or task-specific supervision. Empirically, C-JEPA yields strong gains in visual reasoning, with
especially large improvements on counterfactual questions.
In predictive control, it enables highly efficient planning
with orders of magnitude fewer tokens than patch-based
world models, while achieving comparable performance.

As masked zti is not directly observable, the optimal predictor must rely on other variables to reduce uncertainty. By
Definition 1, Nt (i) is the minimal sufficient subset that preserves the conditional distribution of zti . Any predictor that
ignores variables in Nt (i) therefore incurs strictly higher expected loss. A complete proof is provided in Appendix L.1.
Corollary 1 (Discovery of Intervention-Stable Influence
Neighborhoods). Optimizing Lmask under repeated exposure to diverse object-level masking encourages statedependent attention patterns that align with the influence
neighborhood Nt (i). This can be interpreted as a soft, local
relational structure capturing predictive influence.

We also identify several limitations. Performance depends
on the quality of the object-centric encoder, which can limit
the performance ceiling. Moreover, while we formally characterize influence neighborhoods, we do not directly validate them on datasets with explicit temporal causal graphs,
leaving this to future work. Another promising direction
is jointly refining object-centric encoders using strong pretrained backbones without representational collapse (Ðukić
et al., 2025), as well as evaluating C-JEPA in more complex
environments with richer interactions. Overall, this work
establishes object-level masking as a principled and effective mechanism for introducing causal inductive bias into
efficient, interaction-aware world models.

Corollary 1 is closely related to prior work on invariant
causal prediction (Peters et al., 2016) and invariant risk minimization (Arjovsky et al., 2020), which study predictive
dependencies that remain stable across interventions or environments. In this sense, object-level masking in C-JEPA can
be viewed as inducing a collection of latent interventions,
under which intervention-stable influence neighborhoods
emerge. Further discussion is provided in Appendix L.2.
Remark 2. Influence neighborhoods provide a practical
alternative to full causal discovery in complex dynamical
systems. In realistic settings with latent confounders and
high-dimensional state spaces, identifying true causal parents may be infeasible or ill-defined (Seitzer et al., 2021;

This paper presents work whose goal is to improve the efficiency and interaction-aware learning of task-agnostic world
models and their applications. While advances in world
modeling may have broad downstream impacts in areas
such as robotics, simulation, and decision-making systems,
the methods proposed here are primarily foundational and
methodological. We do not foresee any immediate negative
societal consequences specific to this work beyond those
generally associated with the deployment of learned models,
and therefore do not highlight any particular impacts here.

B. Discussion
B.1. Interpretation of Object-Level Masking as a Latent Intervention
We clarify how object-level masking in C-JEPA can be interpreted as a latent intervention on observability. Crucially,
masking alters the information available to the predictor without modifying the underlying data-generating or transition
mechanism.
Lemma 1 (Latent Intervention via Object-Level Masking). Object-level masking removes direct access to the current latent
state of a masked object zti while preserving access to other object states and auxiliary variables. As a result, prediction of
the future object state is conditioned on a restricted set of observable variables,

Z̄t = Zt \ {zti } ∪ {z̃ti },
where z̃ti is a masked token that does not reveal the current value of zti . This intervention restricts observability at time t
while leaving the transition dynamics unchanged.
Discussion. At a given time step, object-level masking replaces the current latent state of a target object with a masked
token, thereby restricting the predictor’s access to that object while leaving all other inputs unchanged.

Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions

From this perspective, object-level masking acts as a latent intervention on observability. Rather than intervening on the
data-generating process itself, masking induces counterfactual-like prediction problems by forcing the model to reason
about future states under controlled information removal. This interpretation aligns with viewing masking as an intervention
in latent space, enabling the learning of interaction-dependent predictive structure without requiring multiple environments
or explicit causal graph manipulation.
B.2. Relation to Classical Causal Concepts
The notion of an influence neighborhood is related to several classical concepts in causal inference and probabilistic
modeling, but is deliberately defined in a weaker and more operational sense, tailored to masked prediction in object-centric
world models.
Relation to Markov blankets and causal parents. In probabilistic graphical models (Koller & Friedman, 2009), the
Markov blanket of a variable is the minimal set of variables that renders it conditionally independent of all others. Similarly,
in structural causal models (Pearl, 2009), the causal parents of a variable represent its direct causes. Both notions aim to
characterize minimal sufficient sets under strong assumptions, including access to a correct causal graph, causal sufficiency,
and full observability.
In contrast, influence neighborhoods are defined through the masked completion task in Definition 1. They characterize the
(−i)
minimal subset of observable variables within ZT that are sufficient to predict a masked object state zti when its own
history is unobserved, except for a minimal identity anchor. No assumptions are made about the identifiability of a true
causal graph.
As a consequence, an influence neighborhood need not coincide with the set of causal parents. It may include variables
that are causally downstream, correlated through latent confounders, or otherwise informative under partial observability.
Influence neighborhoods should therefore be interpreted as predictively sufficient sets under masking, rather than as estimates
of true causal mechanisms. Nevertheless, we argue that influence neighborhoods still introduce a causal inductive bias, in
the sense that forward prediction in the world model is constrained to be temporally directed, thereby favoring one-way
predictive dependencies from past to future rather than arbitrary symmetric associations.
Relation to invariant causal prediction and invariant risk minimization. Invariant causal prediction (ICP) (Peters et al.,
2016) and invariant risk minimization (IRM) (Arjovsky et al., 2020) aim to identify predictive relationships that remain
stable across environments or interventions. This emphasis on stability aligns conceptually with our focus on predictive
dependencies that persist under object-level masking.
However, existing methods typically assume access to multiple environments from data-generating process or externally
specified interventions. In contrast, C-JEPA induces systematic variations in observability through object-level masking
within a single dataset. Influence neighborhoods are thus defined relative to latent observability interventions, rather than
invariance across externally labeled environments or do-interventions on the data-generating process.
Summary. Overall, influence neighborhoods generalize classical notions of minimal predictive sets to object-centric,
temporally extended, and partially observed settings. They capture which variables are necessary for prediction under
masked completion, without assuming causal sufficiency or aiming to recover a fixed causal graph. This perspective enables
principled analysis of interaction structure in realistic world models while remaining agnostic to causal identifiability.

C. Dataset
C.1. CLEVRER (Yi et al., 2020)
CLEVRER consists of videos with 128 frames at a spatial resolution of 480 × 320. The dataset is split into 10,000 training
videos, 5,000 validation videos, and 5,000 test videos. Visual question answering (VQA) evaluation on the official test set is
performed through the public evaluation server.1
The CLEVRER VQA benchmark includes four categories of questions: descriptive, counterfactual, explanatory, and
predictive. Descriptive questions are evaluated per question, whereas the remaining categories are evaluated both per
1

Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions

question and per answer option.
Due to current unavailability of the evaluation server, we report results on the validation set using the same evaluation
protocol as the test set. All models are trained exclusively on the training split, and the validation set is treated as a held-out
test set during evaluation. No validation data is used for training or model selection. The subset of test-set results available
to us exhibits trends consistent with those reported on the validation set.
The number of objects present in a scene is not fixed and may change over time, as objects can enter or leave the scene
during a video. Across the dataset, the maximum number of simultaneously visible objects is six. Accordingly, we use a
fixed set of seven object slots throughout, where one slot implicitly captures background or empty regions.
C.2. Push-T (Bekris et al., 2025)
The Push-T dataset consists of videos with variable temporal length, where each frame is rendered at a resolution of
224 × 224. The training set contains 18,410 trajectories, and the validation set has 21 trajectories.
The task involves a simple planar manipulation scenario in which a controllable agent, represented as a blue circle, must
push a green T-shaped object into a target configuration, a gray T-shaped object. Success is defined by placing the green
object within a predefined distance threshold of the goal pose.
Proprioceptive inputs have dimensionality four, and actions have dimensionality two. Each scene consistently contains three
objects, and we therefore use four object-centric slots, including one slot reserved for background.

D.1. VideoSAUR (Zadaianchuk et al., 2023)
VideoSAUR (Zadaianchuk et al., 2023) is a video slot attention model built on a frozen DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2024)
backbone that aggregates patch-level features into object-centric slots using a SAVi-style grouping mechanism (Kipf et al.,
2022). It additionally employs a temporal similarity loss to encourage consistency across time, and we adopt it as our
primary object-centric encoder.
Common Setup. Across all experiments, VideoSAUR is trained following the standard protocol. Visual features are
extracted using a frozen DINOv2 ViT-S/14 backbone, producing 196 patch tokens per frame with dimensionality 384. Patch
features are projected to a 128-dimensional latent space and grouped into object-centric slots using Slot Attention with
two iterations. The DINOv2 backbone remains frozen throughout training. Models are trained for 100k steps using Adam
with a base learning rate of 1 × 10−4 , scaled linearly by batch size, and an exponential decay schedule with 2k warmup
steps. Gradients are clipped at 0.05. The training objective combines a feature reconstruction loss on DINOv2 features and
a temporal similarity loss. Unless otherwise specified, remaining training details follow the VideoSAUR setup used for
YouTube-VIS by Wu et al. (2023).

Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions

Training Details on CLEVRER. For CLEVRER, frames are temporally subsampled with stride two. Training uses short
clips of six frames, while validation uses clips of length ten. We use N = 7 slots, a batch size of 32, and set the temporal
similarity loss weight to 0.3. Data normalization on ImageNet statistics and random horizontal flips are applied.
Training Details on Push-T. For Push-T, we use clips of six frames with stride two for both training and validation,
N = 4 slots, and a batch size of 64. The temporal similarity loss weight is increased to 0.25. Training is performed on a
Push-T dataset variant, where each object is moving in a random manner to increase visual and dynamical diversity.
D.2. SAVi (Kipf et al., 2022)
SAVi (Kipf et al., 2022) is a video slot attention model that learns object-centric representations by grouping frame-level
visual features into a fixed set of slots using iterative attention. It reconstructs input frames from slot representations and
serves as a standard object-centric encoder in prior world model and video reasoning work.
Training Details on CLEVRER. For experiments requiring a SAVi-based encoder, we use the stochastic SAVi model
following SlotFormer (Wu et al., 2023), adopting the same architecture and training configuration. Training is performed on
six-frame video clips resized to 64 × 64. The encoder maps RGB frames to 128-dimensional features using a convolutional
backbone, followed by Slot Attention with N = 7 slots and two iterations. Each slot has dimensionality 128. We use the
stochastic SAVi formulation with a Gaussian prior of variance 0.01. Models are trained for 8 epochs using Adam with a
learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a cosine schedule with linear warmup over the first 2.5% of steps. Gradients are clipped at
0.05. The batch size is 32 for training and 64 for validation. The objective consists of an image reconstruction loss and a KL
regularization term weighted by 1 × 10−4 .
D.3. Auxiliary Variable Encoders.
If available, actions and proprioceptive signals are treated as auxiliary variables and embedded separately from object-centric
latents. Both are encoded using lightweight temporal embedders implemented as one-dimensional convolutional layers over
the temporal axis. Each embedder maps raw inputs to a 128-dimensional embedding space for C-JEPA, OC-JEPA, and
OC-DINO-WM, while using a 10-dimensional embedding space for DINO-WM and DINO-WM with Register.

E. Predictors
E.1. Design Choice
We adopt a ViT-style masked predictor rather than an autoregressive Transformer for modeling object-centric dynamics. In
object-centric representations, object states do not evolve as independent first-order Markov processes, but are shaped by
interactions that may span multiple time steps. Autoregressive predictors impose a sequential dependency structure that
conditions each prediction on previously generated tokens, which can bias learning toward local self-dynamics. In contrast,
masked prediction allows the model to attend jointly to the entire history window and infer masked object states in parallel.
This architectural choice aligns naturally with the C-JEPA objective, which requires reasoning over interaction-dependent
context rather than sequential token generation.
E.2. Implementation Details
We maintain object latent states with slot dimensionality 128 throughout the whole experiment. Future prediction is
performed by a Transformer-based predictor with six layers, 16 attention heads, head dimension 64, and an MLP hidden dimension of 2048. Our framework is built on top of stable-pretraining (Balestriero et al., 2025) and
stable-worldmodel (Maes et al., 2026).
E.3. Training Details
For Push-T, the model operates on a temporal history window of size three, with frames subsampled using a frame skip of
five. At each time step, the model predicts a single future latent state. For CLEVRER, the model operates on a temporal
history window of size six, with frames subsampled using a frame skip of two, predicting ten future latent states. During
training, object-level masking is applied by randomly masking between zero and two object slots for Push-T and between
zero and four object slots for CLEVRER.
16

Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions

The model is trained for 30 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 256. The predictor, action encoder, and
proprioceptive encoder use a learning rate of 5 × 10−4 . All experiments are conducted on a single GPU, on pre-extracted
object embeddings.

F. Visual Question Answering
F.1. ALOE (Ding et al., 2021)
For visual question answering, we adopt ALOE (Ding et al., 2021), a transformer-based model for reasoning over objectcentric video representations. ALOE operates directly on object-centric representations extracted from video frames. Given
a sequence of object embeddings over time and a natural-language question, ALOE encodes the question using a language
transformer and represents object trajectories as temporally ordered tokens. A stack of attention layers then performs joint
reasoning over objects, time steps, and question tokens, allowing information to be dynamically routed based on the query.
Importantly, ALOE does not rely on explicit symbolic programs or predefined causal graphs. Instead, relational, temporal,
and counterfactual reasoning emerge from attention over object-level embeddings conditioned on the question.
Training Details on CLEVRER. We train ALOE for visual question answering on the CLEVRER dataset using objectcentric slot trajectories extracted by the encoder. We follow SlotFormer (Wu et al., 2023) for the training configuration.
Each training sample consists of object slot embeddings over 25 time steps, together with a natural-language question and
multiple answer choices. We use a maximum of 6 objects per scene, with each slot represented by a 128-dimensional feature
vector. Object order is fixed across time to preserve temporal consistency.
Questions and answer choices are tokenized with maximum lengths of 20 and 12, respectively. Object trajectories, question
tokens, and answer tokens are concatenated into a single token sequence and processed by a transformer encoder with 12
layers, 8 attention heads, and a feedforward dimension of 512. Learnable positional embeddings are used. The transformer
operates on a shared embedding space of dimension 16, followed by an MLP classifier with hidden size 128 for answer
prediction. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10−3 and a cosine decay schedule
with linear warmup over the first 10% of training steps. Training is performed for 400 epochs following SlotFormer.

G. Model Predictive Control Planning Details
We describe the implementation details of the model predictive control (MPC) pipeline used for goal-conditioned planning
with learned world models. Planning is performed in the latent space induced by the learned world model. Given the current
observation and a goal observation, the planner optimizes a sequence of future actions by rolling out the world model
and minimizing a goal-conditioned cost. Action optimization is carried out using the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), and
execution follows a receding-horizon MPC scheme.
Planning Configuration. In all experiments, we set the planning horizon to H = 5 and use an action block size of B = 5,
resulting in a total action sequence length of L = H × B = 25. The receding horizon is set equal to the planning horizon
(R = 5), such that the full optimized action sequence is executed before replanning. The evaluation budget is fixed to 50
environment steps per episode, and the goal observation is defined as the state occurring 25 steps after the initial frame
sampled from the dataset.
Cost Function. The planning objective minimizes the cost between the predicted last state and the goal state in the latent
space. The cost used is the l2 -loss. Analogous costs are computed for prospective embeddings, which are then added to
the original cost. A rollout is considered successful if the final position error is less than 20 (within a workspace range of
(0, 450)) and the final orientation error is smaller than π/9.
Action Optimization via CEM. Action sequences are optimized using the Cross-Entropy Method. At each replanning
step, CEM samples 300 candidate action sequences from a Gaussian distribution and evaluates their quality from the cost
predicted by the world model. At each step, the 30 candidates with the lowest cost are kept as elites to update the Gaussian
parameters (mean and variance) used for action sampling. The optimization procedure is repeated for 30 iterations, and the
final mean of the distribution is used as the optimized action sequence.
17

Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions

Hungarian Matching for Object-Centric Models. For object-centric world models, the ordering of object slots is not
often perfectly guaranteed to be consistent across time steps or between predicted and goal states. To ensure a meaningful
comparison between object-centric latent states, we apply Hungarian matching when computing rollout trajectories and
planning costs. Specifically, at each predicted time step, object slots are matched to goal slots by minimizing the pairwise
ℓ2 distance in latent space. The planning cost is then computed after alignment, using the matched object representations.
This matching is applied consistently for all object-centric models during MPC planning and does not affect patch-based
baselines, where token ordering is fixed.

SlotFormer (Wu et al., 2023) We reproduce SlotFormer on CLEVRER using the best-performing configuration reported
in the original work. Training is performed on object-centric slots extracted by a pretrained SAVi (Kipf et al., 2022) encoder.
Each training sample consists of 16 frames in total, including 6 burn-in frames and 10 rollout frames, with temporal
subsampling by a factor of two. The dynamics model is implemented as a Transformer-based rollouter with four layers,
eight attention heads, and a model dimension of 256. Sinusoidal temporal positional encodings are applied, while no slot
positional encodings are used.
Training is conducted for 30 epochs (approximately 450k steps) using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 2 × 10−4 .
A cosine learning-rate schedule with linear warmup over the first 5% of training steps is applied. No weight decay or
gradient clipping is used. We use batch size 32 per GPU, using two Nvidia RTX A6000 GPUs. The default training objective
includes both slot-level reconstruction loss and image reconstruction loss, each weighted equally. Image reconstruction is
performed using a CNN decoder initialized from a pretrained SAVi checkpoint. All images are resized to a resolution of
64 × 64.
OCVP-Seq (Villar-Corrales et al., 2023) We reproduce OCVP on CLEVRER using the official implementation and
training protocol. OCVP is also trained on top of pretrained SAVi (Kipf et al., 2022) slot representations, which are kept
fixed throughout training. Video clips are constructed from CLEVRER sequences resized to a spatial resolution of 64 × 64,
with frames temporally subsampled by a factor of two. Each training clip consists of 6 context frames followed by 10 future
frames to predict, resulting in a total sequence length of 16 frames.
OCVP-Seq implemented as a Transformer with 2 layers, 4 attention heads, and a hidden dimension of 256. The internal
token dimension is set to 128, and residual connections are used around the predictor. Autoregressive prediction is performed
with an input buffer size of 6 slots. The model is trained for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of
1 × 10−4 and no weight decay. A cosine learning-rate schedule with a warmup of 5 epochs is applied, and the minimum
learning rate is set to 1 × 10−6 . Training uses a batch size of 64 and mixed-precision on 3 Nvidia RTX A6000 GPUs. The
training objective consists of a mean squared error loss on predicted slot representations. Validation is performed at the end
of every epoch, and all reported results follow the same evaluation protocol as other object-centric baselines.
DINO-WM (Zhou et al., 2025) and DINO-WM with Register (Darcet et al., 2024) We train DINO-WM and its
register-augmented variant on the Push-T manipulation task following the standard DINO-WM training protocol. Both
models share the same architecture and hyperparameters, differing only in the use of register tokens during visual encoding
for DINO-WM with Register.

Input frames are tokenized into non-overlapping 16 × 16 patches. Frames are temporally subsampled with a stride of five.
Each training sequence consists of a history window of three frames followed by one prediction step, resulting in a total
sequence length of four frames. Visual observations are encoded using a frozen DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2024) backbone,
producing patch-level embeddings that are passed to an autoregressive Transformer-based predictor. The predictor consists
of 6 Transformer layers with 16 attention heads, a feedforward dimension of 2048, and a per-head dimensionality of 64.
Dropout with rate 0.1 is applied within the predictor, while embedding dropout is disabled. Actions and proprioceptive
signals are embedded using separate encoders as described in Appendix D.3 with embedding dimensionality 10 and
provided as auxiliary inputs to the predictor. Models are trained for 10 epochs as training more epochs did not improve the
performance and often degrades the performance. We use a batch size of 64. Optimization is performed using Adam with a
learning rate of 5 × 10−4 for the predictor, action encoder, and proprioceptive encoder. All experiments use a fixed random
seed of 42. Unless otherwise specified, all remaining settings follow the original DINO-WM implementation.

OC-DINO-WM OC-DINO-WM replaces the patch-based visual encoder of DINO-WM with an object-centric encoder
based on VideoSAUR. VideoSAUR also operates on a frozen DINOv2 ViT-S/14 backbone, ensuring compatibility with
DINO-WM in terms of visual representation. All other components, including the predictor architecture, auxiliary input
handling, and training protocol, are kept identical to DINO-WM. The model is trained for 30 epochs on Push-T.

OC-JEPA OC-JEPA is a variant of C-JEPA with history masking disabled (|M| = 0). This baseline isolates the effect
of object-centric representations from that of the masking objective, allowing us to assess whether the performance gains
of C-JEPA arise from object-centric encoding alone or from object-level history masking. OC-JEPA shares the same
architecture and training setup as C-JEPA, differing only in the masking configuration. Details of the predictor architecture
and masking scheme are provided in Appendix E.

I. Full Results
Tab. A2 shows VQA performance under different numbers of masked objects. Introducing object-level masking consistently
improves performance over the unmasked baseline, with especially large gains on counterfactual questions. These results
indicate that masking object histories provides a meaningful training signal and strengthens interaction-dependent reasoning.
Tab. A3 compares object-centric baselines using a shared SAVi encoder. C-JEPA achieves the best overall performance
across all question categories, with particularly strong gains on counterfactual and predictive questions. Notably, unlike
prior approaches, C-JEPA attains these improvements without relying on reconstruction losses, suggesting that object-level
masked prediction provides a more effective supervisory signal for interaction reasoning.

J. Exploring Different Masking Strategies
We consider three masking strategies that differ in the structural unit being masked.
• Object-level masking. Entire object-centric slots are masked, requiring the model to infer the masked object’s latent
trajectory from the remaining objects. The masking budget is specified as the number of masked objects out of seven.
• Token-level masking. A random subset of individual latent tokens is masked, following standard masked modeling
practices. The masking budget is reported as the percentage of masked tokens.
• Tube-level masking. Contiguous spatio-temporal tubes of latent tokens are masked, enforcing temporal consistency
within masked regions. The masking budget is again reported as the percentage of masked tokens.
For token- and tube-level masking, we match the masking budget to object-level masking by masking an equivalent
proportion of latent tokens, and for tube masking we further set the number of masked tubes to correspond to the size of the
object masking index set.
Results. Tab. A4 compares object-level masking with token- and tube-level masking under matched masking budgets
on CLEVRER. Across masking strategies, performance generally improves as the masking budget increases, indicating
that masking can act as an effective regularization signal. Rather than viewing object-, token-, and tube-level masking

as fundamentally different mechanisms, they can be interpreted as variants that differ primarily in granularity and mask
shape. Since masking is applied within a relatively small T × N latent space in our setting, the performance differences
between these strategies are correspondingly limited. However, token- and tube-level masking exhibit higher sensitivity to
the masking budget and lead to less consistent improvements. This is because, unlike object-level masking, random masking
at the token or tube level can introduce unintended combinations of missing information, such as simultaneously masking
multiple objects or all object tokens at a given time step. As a result, the induced prediction task may vary substantially
across masking instances, making it harder to consistently enforce interaction-dependent reasoning.
The same trend is reflected in control settings. As shown in Tab. A5 (Push-T), object-level masking maintains robust
planning performance even at higher masking ratios, whereas tube-level masking leads to severe performance degradation
under comparable budgets, and token-level masking provides limited or inconsistent benefits. These results indicate that
masking entire objects, rather than spatiotemporal tubes or individual latent tokens, is critical for inducing meaningful
interaction-aware learning signals without destabilizing prediction or control.

K. Assumptions
Assumption 1 (Temporally Directed Predictive Dependencies) Object-level state transitions are governed by time-directed
predictive dependencies. The future state of an object is determined by past object observation and auxiliary variables
without requiring instantaneous causal effects within the same time step.
Discussion. This assumption rules out within-timestep causal cycles and provides a well-defined temporal direction for
interpreting predictive influence. It is consistent with standard discrete-time modeling, where causal effects are attributed to
variables available up to time t and manifest in states at later times.
Importantly, the assumption does not prohibit the predictor from using same-time-step observations during state completion.
Under object-level masking, the model may condition the reconstruction of a masked token at time t on other objects
observed at the same t. Such within-step conditioning should be understood as completing missing information under partial
observability, rather than positing instantaneous causal generation among objects.
Accordingly, we define causal influence operationally through time-lagged predictive dependencies: variables that help
predict future states from past observations and auxiliary inputs. This avoids over-interpreting attention weights as
instantaneous causal edges while remaining compatible with attention-based predictors that mix information within a
window.
Assumption 2 (Shared Transition Mechanism) Latent state transitions are governed by a shared mechanism. Although
object states vary across time and episodes, the conditional distribution of future states given a finite history remains
invariant across trajectories.
Discussion. This is the standard stationarity assumption underlying learned world models: a single predictor is trained to
approximate the same conditional dynamics across episodes. It allows pooling experience to learn transferable structure and
supports evaluation under rollouts that recombine histories and actions.
The assumption is compatible with diverse trajectories because it constrains only the conditional distribution given history,
not the marginal distribution of states. In practice, moderate nonstationarities (e.g., nuisance variations) are typically
absorbed by the encoder and model capacity; severe regime shifts would require explicit conditioning on context or
environment identifiers, which is outside our scope.
Assumption 3 (Object-Aligned Latent Representation) Each slot corresponds to a coherent object-level state variable and
these representations provide a sufficient abstraction for reasoning about object dynamics.
21

Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions

Discussion. This assumption is a minimal requirement for object-level interventions to be meaningful: masking a slot should
correspond to removing access to an object-level variable rather than an arbitrary mixture of entities. We do not require
perfect disentanglement, fixed semantics across scenes, or a one-to-one correspondence with human-defined objects. Instead,
we require sufficient stability so that slots behave as coherent carriers of object-level information over time, enabling the
predictor to treat them as entities for dynamics modeling.
This is consistent with common practice in slot-based perception. At the same time, it clarifies a practical limitation: the
achievable performance of object-centric world models is bounded by the fidelity of the underlying encoder, and violations
of object alignment can weaken the intended intervention effect of masking.
Assumption 4 (Finite-History Sufficiency) A finite history window of length Th contains sufficient information for predicting
future object states under the predictive dependencies of the system.
Discussion. This assumption reflects the operational constraints of learning and planning, where the model conditions on a
bounded context window. It is weaker than a first-order Markov assumption because it allows higher-order dynamics that
require temporal context (e.g., inferring velocity from multiple frames). In practice, Th trades off information completeness
against computational cost, and the appropriate choice depends on the time scale of interactions and the encoder’s ability to
summarize motion cues.
When the true system exhibits longer memory than Th , the predictor can still learn an approximation, but accuracy may
saturate. Our analysis therefore characterizes the inductive bias induced by masked completion within the chosen window,
which is the regime relevant to the implemented model.

L. Theoretical Analysis
L.1. Proof of Theorem 1
(−i)

Proof. Fix an object index i and a time t. Let Y := zti ∈ Rd denote the target masked state, and let X := ZT denote
the observable completion context. Consider any measurable predictor h that maps X to a prediction Ŷ = h(X). The
(unconditional) MSE risk is


R(h) := E ∥Y − h(X)∥22 .


By the tower property, we can write R(h) = E E[∥Y − h(X)∥22 | X] . Define m(X) := E[Y | X]. Expanding the squared
norm and using E[Y − m(X) | X] = 0, we obtain the standard conditional risk decomposition:




E ∥Y − h(X)∥22 | X = E ∥Y − m(X)∥22 | X + ∥m(X) − h(X)∥22 .
The first term does not depend on h, and the second term is minimized (pointwise in X) uniquely by choosing h(X) = m(X)
almost surely. Thus the Bayes-optimal predictor for MSE satisfies
h
i
(−i)
h∗ (X) = E[Y | X] and hence ẑti ∗ = E zti | ZT
,
which gives the first equality in Eq. equation 10.
(−i)

It remains to show that conditioning on ZT
is equivalent to conditioning on the influence neighborhood Nt (i). By
(−i)
Definition 1, Nt (i) ⊆ ZT and


(−i)
p zti | ZT
= p zti | Nt (i) .
Therefore, for any integrable function φ,
h



(−i)
E φ(zti ) | ZT
= E φ(zti ) | Nt (i)

a.s.

Taking φ to be the identity function on Rd yields
h
i


(−i)
E zti | ZT
= E zti | Nt (i) ,
which gives the second equality in Eq. equation 10.
Finally, let h be any predictor that fails to utilize information in Nt (i). Then there exists a set of contexts with nonzero
probability on which h(X) ̸= h∗ (X) = E[Y | X], implying ∥m(X)−h(X)∥22 > 0 on that set. By the decomposition above,
R(h) > R(h∗ ), so h cannot attain the minimum achievable expected reconstruction error under masked completion.
22

L.2. Justification of Corollary 1
We provide a justification for Corollary 1, which states that optimizing the masked prediction objective induces attention
patterns aligned with the influence neighborhood.
Consider an attention-based predictor in which each predicted object state is computed by aggregating information from
input variables through learned attention weights. Under object-level masking, Theorem 1 implies that variables outside the
influence neighborhood Nt (i) are conditionally uninformative for predicting the masked state zti . Consequently, assigning
attention to such variables cannot reduce the Bayes risk.
In an expressive attention-based model class, there therefore exist optimal solutions that concentrate attention on variables
within Nt (i) while assigning negligible weight to uninformative variables. Repeated exposure to diverse masking patterns
acts as a collection of latent interventions, favoring predictive dependencies that remain stable across interventions. This
gives rise to state-dependent and soft relational patterns aligned with the intervention-stable influence neighborhood.
This interpretation is closely related to prior work on invariant causal prediction (Peters et al., 2016) and invariant risk
minimization (Arjovsky et al., 2020), which study predictors whose dependencies remain stable across environments
or interventions. In C-JEPA, object-level masking plays an analogous role by inducing intervention-stable predictive
dependencies in latent space, without explicitly estimating a causal graph.
